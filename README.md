**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Vincent Goods**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [*] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [*] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [*] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [*] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [*] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [*] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [*] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [*] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
StackOverflow
Geeks for Geeks

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One of the challenges that I encountered was when I would try to play the game and sometimes the game would either not light up the button,
play the sound, or both. When this error occured I belived it came from my script code but I had no idea in which area for a while and I began to 
tweak with all of my script code. Seeing that this was not working and definantly not one of my best ideas I did some research on why my buttons
would not be working at certain times. I fell apon a stackoverflow forrum that was a complete help and helped me where my problems alligned. 
To fix the error I the game was going through I had to change the for statment in the startgame() function and add the math logistics for it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing this submisson a main question I have for web develpment is can you implement different code into this type of devlopment. With me 
not having any HTML experiance beofre this I thought that this would be unachievable but when I looked at the concepts for the game it had many
simularities to other coding languages. So with that being said could you use a higher or more flexable lanuage for web devlopment. Also how
does security for web development and what measures are in place. I know Im only making a light game but is there anyway in other web development
cases does seuity come into place and become a factor.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would probably add more buttons and find way to make the game more interactive for the user.
I think adding more buttons would make the game more fun and challenging and also could implement new sounds and colors for the game. I would also 
add numbers to the buttons for the users to help keep track of the sequence which would make it more user friendly. I would also incorperate 
a backgorund feature with it bliking a cretain color when sequence guesses where correct and another color when a guess was wrong. I would also want 
to make a multipler type gamemode where one person has to beat anothers high score.
